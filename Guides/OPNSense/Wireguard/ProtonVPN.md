# OPNSense Wireguard ProtonVPN Selective Routing Setup and Configuration

This guide works as of 13th November 2023 with OPNsense 23.7.8

This guide is mainly being used a reminder for myself when i inevitably decide to change something with my router config and also hopefully a helping hand for other users.

## Step 1: Install Updates, Plugins and Enable SSH

### Update OPNSense and Install Wireguard
1. Before we start anything we need to update our OPNSense.
2. Navigate to **`System > Firmware > Status > Updates`**
3. If updates are needed. Wait for them to download, install and possibly restart the system. Once that is finished we are good to continue
4. Navigate to **`System > Firmware > Plugins`**
5. Search for **`os-wireguard`** (choose os-wireguard not os-wireguard-go)
6. Press `+` to install

### Enable SSH
1. Navigate to **`System > Settings > Administration`**
2. Check **`Enable Secure Shell`** if it's not already checked. (You should disable Secure Shell once this guide has been completed)
3. SSH is already installed for Linux and Mac users.
4. If you are a windows user which I am not. Use either PuTTY or Windows PowerShell.

## Step 2: Proton Configuration
1. Access https://account.protonvpn.com/downloads
2. Go about half way down the page until you find **`WireGuard Configuration`**
3. Enter a name for the config file to be generated. (For this i decided to keep it simple and name it **`OPNSense`** but you can name it whatever you would like)
4. Select **`Router`** as your platform
5. Now the next part of selecting the VPN options is entirely your choice but I personally have the 'Block malware, ads, & trackers' option aswell as VPN Accelerator enabled as its just nice to have.
6. Hit create when you are happy with your config

The config file I will be referencing in this guide
```
[Interface]
# Key for Tutorial
# Bouncing = 4
# NetShield = 2
# Moderate NAT = off
# NAT-PMP (Port Forwarding) = off
# VPN Accelerator = on
PrivateKey = yMIf4bUinsvT7XMuDrA7EePIxvfeV0bH6BSnV2Zdg0A=
Address = 10.2.0.2/32
DNS = 10.2.0.1

[Peer]
# US-CA#323
PublicKey = hYKR1itwhCnthIPSMnQ3p38X3Fx54wkimogq/UJdzCY=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 146.70.195.98:51820
```

We are nearly all set except we are missing the interface public key which we have to get ourselves from SSH

1. SSH into your OPNsense server with `ssh root@192.168.1.1`
2. Choose Option 8
3. Enter the following command: `echo <InterfacePrivateKey> | wg pubkey`

For example:
`echo yMIf4bUinsvT7XMuDrA7EePIxvfeV0bH6BSnV2Zdg0A= | wg pubkey`

4. The interface public key will then be displayed.

For example:
`Interface Public Key: oTI8o1lHl2ZwViGOJpCM+uRNdruCojcCHAAJEbZadV0=`

## Step 3. OPNsense Configuration

### Peer Configuration (Endpoint)

1. Navigate to **`VPN > WireGuard > Peers`**
2. Select the `+` to add a new endpoint
3. Enter your configuration like belows example:
```
Enabled:             *Checked*
Name:                <Something easy to recognise> eg. Proton_US_CA-233
Public Key:          <Peer Public Key> eg. hYKR1itwhCnthIPSMnQ3p38X3Fx54wkimogq/UJdzCY=
Shared Secret:       <Leave empty>
Allowed IPs:         0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint Address:    <Peer Endpoint IP> eg. 146.70.195.98
Endpoint Port:       51820
Instances:           <Leave empty for now>
Keepalive Interval:  25
```

DNS Server:          <Leave empty otherwise you will override your DNS config>
Tunnel Address:      <10.2.0.2/28 as setting it as /32 will cause some issues later>
Depend on (CARP)     <None>
Peers:               <Select the peer you just create> eg. Proton_US_CA-233

Set local tag:         NO_WAN_EGRESS
```
#### NO_WAN_EGRESS is a VPN Killswitch which stops traffic intended for the VPN from going out the normal WAN gateway if the tunnel gateway goes down

4. Move this rule above all other firewall rules as OPNSense Firewall Rules work from top to bottom
5. Click save and then Apply.

```
4. Move this rule above all other firewall rules
5. Click save and then Apply.
